A telecommunications company is building networks that require the installation of expensive equipment (the
major components cost at least $1 million). There are many places where the equipment might be installed, and
by selectively choosing where to put the most-expensive pieces of equipment, the company might be able to
reduce its expenditures by millions of dollars. 

This project deals with developing a minimization model to create a strategy for investment for the companies. Heuristices have been generated to achieve optimality in one network and a 2.2% gap optimality is achieved in the other network due to computational limitations
